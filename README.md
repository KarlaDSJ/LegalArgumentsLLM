# Discovering the Potential of LLMs in Annotating Legal Texts for Argument Mining

In this repository we explore the use of LLMs to facilitate the annotation of legal texts, specifically focusing on identifying premises and claims within the ECHR dataset. Our preliminary results demonstrate the promising potential of LLMs to assist legal experts in annotating additional legal corpora. 

## Overview 

- ECHR dataset: Contains the subset of the ECHR dataset used for this work. The suffix "_short" omits the header of the resolution.

- Code: For experiments with Llama and Saul, we use the ArgumentationPipelineRefactored. The notebooks generate the output folders for the work similarity. The recap_am folder contains the functions for the argueBuf work.

- Arg_similarity: The "input_arg" file contains the original arguments and the arguments generated by the LLM or the "argueBuf" function.
