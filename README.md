# Discovering the Potential of LLMs in Annotating Legal Texts for Argument Mining

In this repository we explore the use of LLMs to facilitate the annotation of legal texts, specifically focusing on identifying premises and claims within the ECHR dataset. Our preliminary results demonstrate the promising potential of LLMs to assist legal experts in annotating additional legal corpora. 

## Overview 

- ECHR dataset: Contains the subset for ECHR dataset used for that work. The sufix '_short' is the main part omiten the header of the resolution.

- Code: For the experiments with Llama and Saul we use the ArgumentationPipelineRefactored. The notebooks with the work similarity generates the output folders. The folder recap_am contains the funtions for the work argueBuf.

- Arg_similarity: The 'input_arg' files contains the original arguments and the arguments generated by LLM or by the argueBuf work.
