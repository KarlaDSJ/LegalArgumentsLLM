    "            - Argument from established rule: Example: \"For all x, if doing A is the established rule for x, then x must do A (subject to exceptional cases).\"\n",
    "            - Argument from precedent case: Example: \"Case C0 would set a precedent with respect to an existing rule R. Case C0 is similar to case C1. C1 needs to be treated equally with respect to rule R as case C0.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "            Preferred Structure:\n",

      "\n",
      "1. Argument\n",
      "**Claim:** The application is incompatible ratione personae with the provisions of the Convention and this aspect of the case must be rejected under Article 27 para. 2 (Art. 27-2) of the Convention.\n",
      "**Premises:**\n",
      "- Even though they own the fourth applicant company, no evidence of any criticism of the company or any prejudice to its reputation has been put forward.\n",
      "- In these circumstances, the Commission concludes that the fourth applicant company cannot claim to be a victim of a violation of the Convention.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Argument\n",
      "**Claim:** The complaint has two aspects: (a) that the applicants cannot bring a civil claim against the Inspectors or the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry in order to clear their reputations, allegedly sullied in the report; and (b) that the applicants felt obliged to withdraw libel proceedings against The Observer newspaper because, after the publication of the report, which partly related to matters in issue in those proceedings, a fair hearing would allegedly have been impossible.\n",
      "**Premises:**\n",
      "- The applicants have submitted that the publication of the report resulted in massive adverse publicity in the media, the wholesale destruction of their reputations and a general belief in their dishonesty and criminal guilt.\n",
      "- They have claimed, inter alia, that they had no effective safeguards or domestic remedies against this because of the great breadth of the Secretary of State's and the Inspectors' discretionary powers, the restrictive scope of judicial review and the impossibility of suing the Inspectors or the Secretary of State in the civil courts for defamation because they would have had a defence of absolute or qualified privilege.\n",
      "- The applicants have complained that the report hopelessly blighted the defamation proceedings against The Observer, which they withdrew as a result. Other such proceedings would have been futile.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Argument\n",
      "**Claim:** The Government have submitted, inter alia, that the applicants' complaints about the consequences for them of the publication of the report were exaggerated and unsubstantiated.\n",
      "**Premises:**\n",
      "- The extensive publicity after the report's publication was ephemeral.\n",
      "- Whilst it is true that an action in defamation against these public officials would probably have been successfully defended on the ground of privilege, this merely reflects the limited content of the right to reputation under domestic law, rather than the right of access to court for determining the applicants' civil rights under Article 6 para. 1 (Art. 6-1) of the Convention.\n",
      "- The Government have contended that the applicants could have brought defamation proceedings against others, particularly proceedings against Lonrho and The Observer, and those who worked for them, in respect of the allegedly serious improprieties committed by them during Lonrho's acrimonious campaign and, more particularly, in respect of the very matters central to the Inspectors' report.\n",
      "- The Government have disputed a claim made by the applicants that any jury would have been swayed by the publication of the report.\n",

      "\n",
      "1. Argument\n",
      "**Claim:** The Commission finds that the complaint has two aspects.\n",
      "**Premises:**\n",
      "- The Commission finds that the complaint has two aspects.\n",
      "- The first aspect is that the applicants cannot bring a civil claim against the inspectors or the Secretary of State.\n",
      "- The second aspect is that the publication of the report resulted in massive adverse publicity in the media, which allegedly destroyed the applicants' reputations and made a fair hearing impossible.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Argument\n",
      "**Claim:** The applicants' complaints about the consequences of the publication of the report were exaggerated and unsubstantiated.\n",
      "**Premises:**\n",
      "- The extensive publicity after the report's publication was ephemeral.\n",
      "- The applicants' claim that an action in defamation against public officials would probably have been successfully defended on the ground of privilege merely reflects the limited content of the right to reputation under domestic law.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Argument\n",
      "**Claim:** The applicants could have brought defamation proceedings against others.\n",
      "**Premises:**\n",
      "- The applicants could have brought defamation proceedings against others, particularly proceedings against Lonrho and The Observer, and those who worked for them.\n",
      "- The Government have disputed the applicants' claim that any jury trial of these issues would have been biased and that they therefore had to withdraw the defamation proceedings against The Observer.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Argument\n",
      "**Claim:** The publication of the Inspectors' report violated the presumption of innocence.\n",
      "**Premises:**\n",
      "- Article 6 para. 1 (Art. 6-1) of the Convention guarantees a fair hearing in the determination of criminal charges.\n",
      "- Article 6 para. 2 (Art. 6-2) of the Convention provides that anyone \"charged with a criminal offence shall be presumed innocent until proved guilty according to law\".\n",
      "- The applicants have contended that the Inspectors' report made statements about them which amounted to findings of criminal conduct.\n",
      "- Article 6 para. 2 (Art. 6-2) of the Convention requires public officials to refrain from declaring or pronouncing that an individual is guilty of a criminal offence, where guilt has not been proved by a fair judicial process satisfying the requirements of Article 6 (Art. 6).\n",

      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Here are the arguments extracted from the text:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Argument\n",
      "**Claim:** This part of the application cannot be regarded as being manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 27 para. 2 of the Convention.\n",
      "**Premises:**\n",
      "- This part of the application raises a serious question of fact and law which is of such complexity that its determination should depend on an examination of the merits.\n",
      "- No other ground for declaring it inadmissible has been established.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Argument\n",
      "**Claim:** The publication of the Inspectors' report violated the presumption of innocence.\n",
      "**Premises:**\n",
      "- Article 6 para. 2 of the Convention requires public officials to refrain from declaring or pronouncing that an individual is guilty of a criminal offence, where guilt has not been proved by a fair judicial process satisfying the requirements of Article 6.\n",
      "- The applicants were not persons who had been charged with a criminal offence within the meaning of Article 6 paras. 1 and 2 of the Convention.\n",
      "- The Inspectors had not conducted a criminal investigation, and their report did not make any findings of criminal conduct by the applicants.\n",
      "- Although dishonesty is reprehensible, it is not a criminal offence.\n",
      "- The applicants could have considered themselves affected by a possible criminal prosecution and therefore, \"charged\", within the meaning of Article 6 para. 2 of the Convention, but once the Director of Public Prosecutions and the Director of the Serious Fraud Office issued their public statements that the applicants would not be prosecuted, there can be no question of the applicants being deemed to have been \"charged\" any longer.\n",
      "\n",
      "Note: There may be additional arguments or premises that could be extracted from the text, but these are the primary ones that can be identified.\n",
      "\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Here are the arguments extracted from the text:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Argument\n",
      "**Claim:** The applicants' rights under Article 6 paras. 1 and 2 of the Convention in respect of the earlier risk of criminal prosecution were not infringed.\n",
      "**Premises:**\n",
      "- The Inspectors had not conducted a criminal investigation.\n",
      "- The Inspectors had been appointed to investigate and report on the fourth applicant's affairs, and, in particular, the acquisition of shares in House of Fraser plc (HOF) in 1984 and 1985.\n",
      "- Before the Inspectors' report was published, it was clearly and publicly stated by the competent authorities that no criminal proceedings would be brought against the applicants.\n",
      "- The Inspectors had not made any findings of criminal conduct by the applicants.\n",
      "- They considered that the applicants had been dishonest over certain matters, but dishonesty is not a criminal offence.\n",
      "- The Commission considers that while the Inspectors' report was being studied by the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) and the Director of the Serious Fraud Office (SFO), the applicants could have considered themselves affected by a possible criminal prosecution and therefore, \"charged\", within the meaning of Article 6 para. 2 of the Convention.\n",
      "- However, once these officials had issued their public statements on 1 March 1990 that the applicants would not be prosecuted, there can, in the Commission's view, be no question of the applicants being deemed to have been \"charged\" any longer.\n",
      "- The Inspectors' report was published a week after the DPP and SFO statements.\n",
      "- The report made no findings that the applicants had committed any criminal offence, although it was critical of certain aspects of their business affairs.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Argument\n",
      "**Claim:** The making and publication of the Inspectors' report constituted an unjustified interference with the applicants' private lives, contrary to Article 8 of the Convention.\n",
      "**Premises:**\n",
      "- English law provides no enforceable right to privacy and no safeguards or limitations on the scope of investigations and reports of the kind seen in this case.\n",
      "- The report referred to unwarranted aspects of the applicants' private lives and labelled them as dishonest, which had adverse effects on their reputation.\n",
      "- Even if some of the investigations into the applicants' personal background was legitimate, it was unacceptable and wholly disproportionate to inquire into details of the Fayeds' family and business history, followed by the wholesale publication of private information.\n",
      "- Any public interest in the conclusions of the Inspectors or the general lessons to be learnt for future commercial practice could have been satisfied by partial publication of the report, but English law did not allow this.\n",
      "- The report could only be published in its entirety or not at all.\n",
      "- Nor was there any need to protect others' rights, such as those of Lonrho, by publishing the report in its entirety, as their rights were adequately secured by the ordinary courts.\n",
      "\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Here are the arguments extracted from the text:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Argument\n",
      "**Claim:** The applicants' rights under Article 6 paras. 1 and 2 (Art. 6-1, 6-2) of the Convention were not infringed.\n",
      "**Premises:**\n",
      "- Consequently, the Commission finds that the remedy cannot realistically have been available to the applicants in this case.\n",
      "- Further, the Commission finds that the applicants' choice of pursuing proceedings in the courts of Northern Ireland was not unreasonable or without basis in domestic law.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Argument\n",
      "**Claim:** The applicants' rights under Article 8 (Art. 8) of the Convention were not infringed.\n",
      "**Premises:**\n",
      "- The report referred to unwarranted aspects of the applicants' private lives and labelled them as dishonest, which had adverse effects on their reputation.\n",

      "\n",
      "3. Argument\n",
      "**Claim:** The report did not interfere with the private lives of the applicants.\n",
      "**Premises:**\n",
      "- The applicants had themselves put their reputation into the public domain before the Inspectors were appointed by the hiring of public relations professionals for this purpose and ensuring media coverage.\n",
      "- The inquiries made by the Inspectors were necessary to establish whether the applicants were who they claimed to be - longstanding successful and wealthy businessmen.\n",
      "- The Inspectors were aware of the need for privacy and proceeded in whatever manner was least obtrusive to the applicants' privacy.\n",
      "- Even if there had been an interference with the applicants' private lives, it was in accordance with the law and necessary for overwhelming reasons of public interest.\n",
      "- Publication was delayed until questions of criminal prosecution had been decided, and sufficient notice was given to the applicants at all stages of the report to enable them to seek judicial review to prevent publication if they saw fit.\n",
      "- Publication was also necessary to protect the economic well-being of the country as the report revealed weakness in the system of takeover bids.\n",
      "- Publication thereby protected those operating that system in the future.\n",
      "- It was also necessary to protect the rights and freedoms of others, such as those of Lonrho, its shareholders and associates, by confirming that their allegations about the applicants had been well-founded.\n",
      "- Moreover, the report was well-balanced and did not go further than was necessary for the Inspectors' legitimate purpose.\n",
      "- It was not wholly negative about the applicants but gave them credit for their management of HOF.\n",

       "  'content': 'Here is the text: ``` The applicant, a Turkish national born in 1963, was a welder by profession. He died on 16 April 1994. His legal representatives before the Commission are Professor Kevin Boyle and Ms. Françoise Hampson, both university teachers at the University of Essex.A. The particular circumstances of the case The facts of the present case are in dispute. It is claimed on behalf of the applicant that the following events occurred: On 24 November 1992, the applicant was at home with his family. At around 23.00 to 24.00 hours, about twenty policemen arrived, some in uniform and some in plain clothes. They searched the house. They were accompanied by someone who had shown them the house. The applicant\\'s father, mother and five brothers were also at home that night. The applicant was taken, together with one of his brothers, to Kiziltepe Security Headquarters. His brother was released after 11 days. The applicant\\'s house was raided throughout the week following his incarceration. On the ninth day of his detention, his father was taken into custody. The applicant spent the first night in Kiziltepe Security Headquarters and was then transferred to Mardin Political Branch Headquarters. He was held there for 16 days. He was asked whether he knew someone called Metin. On the second day the applicant was taken to the interrogation room where the blindfold which had been over his eyes was removed. He was shown a person called Metin who had accompanied the police when the applicant was arrested. The applicant was then stripped naked and his hands were tied behind his back. He was strung up. This kind of torture is known as \"Palestinian hanging\". While he was strung up, the police connected electrodes to his genitals. He was kicked, slapped and verbally abused in every imaginable way. As they electrocuted him, the police threw water over him. He was again blindfolded during this torture. As far as he could tell, it continued for about 35 minutes. During the next two days, he was repeatedly  beaten at intervals of two hours or half an hour, without being suspended. The torture continued for four days, the first two being very intensive. He lost the movement of his arms and hands as a result. His interrogators ordered him to make movements to restore the control of his hands. The applicant asked to see a doctor, but was refused. Before people were released they were seen by a doctor. When the applicantknew that the doctor was in the building, he unsuccessfully banged on his door to get attention. The applicant was kept in a cell with two others. The cell measured about 1,5 x 3 metres. There was one bed and one blanket between them. There was no pillow. Two days before his release, the police took the applicant to see an official forensic doctor, but the doctor gave him no medicine and wrote no report or prescription. When the doctor asked how the applicant\\'s arms had been injured, the accompanying police officers intervened and said that the applicant had had an accident. It is alleged that the doctor commented, mockingly, that everyone who went to those police headquarters suffered an accident. On 10 December 1992, the applicant was released. He had been brought previously before the public prosecutor. He was presented with a statement to sign, but the applicant said that its contents were untrue and that he had been tortured. The prosecutor insisted he sign it. When he told the prosecutor that he could not sign because he could not move his hands, the prosecutor bowed his head and said, \"You are free to go\". The prosecutor did not ask any questions about the applicant\\'s condition or its causes. Rather his energies were directed at determining whether the applicant should be prosecuted. The applicant was released on a Thursday and saw a doctor on the Friday. The following Tuesday, he completed the hospital paperwork and was admitted to Dicle University Medical Faculty. The applicant\\'s account of his treatment in custody is consistent with a medical report from this Faculty, but the doctor whom he consulted was too frightened to record an explicit explanation of the cause of the applicant\\'s injuries. A medical report from a surgeon at St. George\\'s Hospital, London, based on photographs of the applicant\\'s injuries, supports the applicant\\'s claims of his torture in custody. The applicant remained in hospital until 31 December 1992. On 21 December 1992, the public prosecutor decided that there were no grounds to institute criminal proceedings agai```'}]"

       "  'content': 'Here is the text: ``` The applicant, a Turkish national born in 1963, was a welder by profession. He died on 16 April 1994. His legal representatives before the Commission are Professor Kevin Boyle and Ms. Françoise Hampson, both university teachers at the University of Essex.A. The particular circumstances of the case The facts of the present case are in dispute. It is claimed on behalf of the applicant that the following events occurred: On 24 November 1992, the applicant was at home with his family. At around 23.00 to 24.00 hours, about twenty policemen arrived, some in uniform and some in plain clothes. They searched the house. They were accompanied by someone who had shown them the house. The applicant\\'s father, mother and five brothers were also at home that night. The applicant was taken, together with one of his brothers, to Kiziltepe Security Headquarters. His brother was released after 11 days. The applicant\\'s house was raided throughout the week following his incarceration. On the ninth day of his detention, his father was taken into custody. The applicant spent the first night in Kiziltepe Security Headquarters and was then transferred to Mardin Political Branch Headquarters. He was held there for 16 days. He was asked whether he knew someone called Metin. On the second day the applicant was taken to the interrogation room where the blindfold which had been over his eyes was removed. He was shown a person called Metin who had accompanied the police when the applicant was arrested. The applicant was then stripped naked and his hands were tied behind his back. He was strung up. This kind of torture is known as \"Palestinian hanging\". While he was strung up, the police connected electrodes to his genitals. He was kicked, slapped and verbally abused in every imaginable way. As they electrocuted him, the police threw water over him. He was again blindfolded during this torture. As far as he could tell, it continued for about 35 minutes. During the next two days, he was repeatedly  beaten at intervals of two hours or half an hour, without being suspended. The torture continued for four days, the first two being very intensive. He lost the movement of his arms and hands as a result. His interrogators ordered him to make movements to restore the control of his hands. The applicant asked to see a doctor, but was refused. Before people were released they were seen by a doctor. When the applicantknew that the doctor was in the building, he unsuccessfully banged on his door to get attention. The applicant was kept in a cell with two others. The cell measured about 1,5 x 3 metres. There was one bed and one blanket between them. There was no pillow. Two days before his release, the police took the applicant to see an official forensic doctor, but the doctor gave him no medicine and wrote no report or prescription. When the doctor asked how the applicant\\'s arms had been injured, the accompanying police officers intervened and said that the applicant had had an accident. It is alleged that the doctor commented, mockingly, that everyone who went to those police headquarters suffered an accident. On 10 December 1992, the applicant was released. He had been brought previously before the public prosecutor. He was presented with a statement to sign, but the applicant said that its contents were untrue and that he had been tortured. The prosecutor insisted he sign it. When he told the prosecutor that he could not sign because he could not move his hands, the prosecutor bowed his head and said, \"You are free to go\". The prosecutor did not ask any questions about the applicant\\'s condition or its causes. Rather his energies were directed at determining whether the applicant should be prosecuted. The applicant was released on a Thursday and saw a doctor on the Friday. The following Tuesday, he completed the hospital paperwork and was admitted to Dicle University Medical Faculty. The applicant\\'s account of his treatment in custody is consistent with a medical report from this Faculty, but the doctor whom he consulted was too frightened to record an explicit explanation of the cause of the applicant\\'s injuries. A medical report from a surgeon at St. George\\'s Hospital, London, based on photographs of the applicant\\'s injuries, supports the applicant\\'s claims of his torture in custody. The applicant remained in hospital until 31 December 1992. On 21 December 1992, the public prosecutor decided that there were no grounds to institute criminal proceedings agai```'}]"
