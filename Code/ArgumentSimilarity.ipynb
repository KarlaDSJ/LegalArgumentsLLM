There shall be no interference by a public authority with        the exercise of this right except such as is in accordance with        the law and is necessary in a democratic society in the interests        of national security, public safety or the economic well-being        of the country, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the        protection of health or morals, or for the protection of the        rights and freedoms of others.\"\n",

      "The Government accepted that if Article 5 para. 4 (art. 5-4) conferred additional rights to challenge the lawfulness of the applicant's continued detention, there would have been a breach of that provision (art. 5-4) but only to the extent that the Parole Board had no general power to order the release of the applicant after the expiry of his tariff.\n",

      "1 : the Norris v. Ireland judgment of 26 October 1988, Series A no. 142, and the Modinos v. Cyprus judgment of 22 April 1993, Series A no. 259). \n",
      "This, in itself, suffices to distinguish the present case from those applications which have previously been examined by the Court concerning consensual homosexual behaviour in private between adults where no such feature was present (see the Dudgeon judgment cited above,\n",
      "2 : The Court observes that not every sexual activity carried out behind closed doors necessarily falls within the scope of Article 8 (art. 8).\n",
      "In the present case, the applicants were involved in consensual sado-masochistic activities for purposes of sexual gratification.\n",
      "There can be no doubt that sexual orientation and activity concern an intimate aspect of private life (see, mutatis mutandis, the Dudgeon v. the United Kingdom judgment of 22 October 1981, Series A no. 45, p. 21, para. 52).\n",
      "However, a considerable number of people were involved in the activities in question which included, inter alia, the recruitment of new \"members\", the provision of several specially equipped \"chambers\", and the shooting of many videotapes which were distributed among the \"members\" (see paragraphs 8 and 9 above).\n",
      "It may thus be open to question whether the sexual activities of the applicants fell entirely within the notion of \"private life\" in the particular circumstances of the case. \n",
      "However, since this point has not been disputed by those appearing before it, the Court sees no reason to examine it of its own motion in the present case.\n",
      "Assuming, therefore, that the prosecution and conviction of the applicants amounted to an interference with their private life, the question arises whether such an interference was \"necessary in a democratic society\" within the meaning of the second paragraph of Article 8 (art. 8-2).\n",

      "The State authorities therefore acted within their margin of appreciation in order to protect its citizens from real risk of serious physical harm or injury.\n",
      "13 : In any event, like the Court of Appeal, the Court does not consider that the facts in the Wilson case were at all comparable in seriousness to those in the present case (see paragraph 30 above). \n",
      " Accordingly, the Court considers that the reasons given by the national authorities for the measures taken in respect of the applicants were relevant and sufficient for the purposes of Article 8 para. 2 (art. 8-2).\n",

      "Not everything that happens behind closed doors is necessarily acceptable.\n",

      "1 : The prosecution and conviction of the applicants for assault and wounding in the course of consensual sado-masochistic activities between adults was in breach of Article 8 of the Convention (art. 8).\n",
      "It was common ground among those appearing before the Court that the criminal proceedings against the applicants which resulted in their conviction constituted an \"interference by a public authority\" with the applicants’ right to respect for their private life.\n",
      "It was similarly undisputed that the interference had been \"in accordance with the law\".\n",
      "The Commission and the applicants accepted the Government’s assertion that the interference pursued the legitimate aim of the \"protection of health or morals\", within the meaning of the second paragraph of Article 8 (art. 8 2).\n",
      "2 : The interference in issue could not be regarded as \"necessary in a democratic society\" within the meaning of the second paragraph of Article 8 (art. 8-2).\n",

      "Participation in the acts complained of was carefully restricted and controlled and was limited to persons with like-minded sado-masochistic proclivities.\n",
      "The acts were not witnessed by the public at large and there was no danger or likelihood that they would ever be so witnessed.\n",
      "No serious or permanent injury had been sustained, no infection had been caused to the wounds, and no medical treatment had been required.\n",
      "No complaint was ever made to the police who learnt about the applicants’ activities by chance.\n",

      "To the extent that issues of public morality had arisen with reference to Mr Laskey’s conviction for keeping a disorderly house and for the possession of an indecent photograph of a child these had been dealt with under the relevant sexual offences provisions and appropriately punished.\n",

      "8 : The applicants' case should be viewed as one involving matters of sexual expression, rather than violence.\n",
      "With due regard to this consideration, the line beyond which consent is no defence to physical injury should only be drawn at the level of intentional or reckless causing of serious disabling injury.\n",
      "12 : The notion of necessity implies that the interference corresponds to a pressing social need and, in particular, that it is proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued.\n",
      "The Court will take into account that a margin of appreciation is left to the national authorities (see, inter alia, the Olsson v. Sweden (no. 1) judgment of 24 March 1988, Series A no. 130, pp. 31-32, para. 67), whose decision remains subject to review by the Court for conformity with the requirements of the Convention.\n",
